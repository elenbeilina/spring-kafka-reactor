## Simple reactive Kafka web application.

> #### Important notes:
> - Source: events that are generated by api call;
> - Target: test topic;
> - Receiver does not work without group.id;
> - By api call application sends events to Kafka test topic, count needs to be provided;
> - Reliever starts receiving events from Kafka, when client subscribes by api call;
> - Only one client can be subscribed;
> - In order to support multiple clients - receiver needs to be created for each of the client with unique group.id.
